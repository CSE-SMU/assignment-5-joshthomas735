# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?
	Josh Thomas


## How difficult was this assignment?
	This assignment was difficult in the good way. Really pushed me to delve into devleoping with Ionic, and gave me more practice using AngularJS. I really enjoyed the assignment 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
	I got a much better understanding of AngularJS and now I know how to use Ionic. So yes, I learned lots. 


## How could this assignment be improved?
	Not sure. Seemed like the class as a whole had trouble getting started with Ionic, so perhaps the only needed thing is more explination and introduction up front. 


## Any other comments?	
	Nope.
